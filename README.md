# GRU-ML-presentation
Presentation of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) algorithm for the Machine Learning II: Deep Learning Methods class at my university. The model was implemented in PyTorch on an Air Pollution dataset from kaggle and its performance was compared to a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.
